StudentExamLogger

Objective:To develop a program that simulates multiple students submitting exam scores at the same time using multithreading, and to store their scores in a CSV file with thread-safe file writing

Student.java             → Defines student details and CSV format

ScoreWriter.java         → Handles synchronized file writing

StudentLoggerThread.java → Thread class for each student submission
Main.java                → Creates threads and starts execution


ScoreWriterTest.java     → JUnit test to verify file write

README.md                → Project documentation (this file)

How to Run:

Open project 

Run Main.java

Check scores.csv for student entries

Test:

Run ScoreWriterTest.java using JUnit
